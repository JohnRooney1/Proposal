# Technical Technique Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
- Brief overview: Data Wrangling, Handling missing values.
  In this Presentation, I will be focusing on one of the fundamental aspects of data wrangling, which is handling missing values. Missing data is a common issue in datasets and can significantly impact analysis outcomes if it is not addressed properly. 
- Importance: Effective handling of missing values is crucial for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of any given data.
- Objectives of the presentation: The objective of the presentation is to highlight the significance of handling missing values and to introduce different techniques for identifying and addressing it. 

## Background
- Missing values pose a challenge across various domains. Using new software like Pandas can help fix these challenges more effectivley.
- Challenges: Determining what is causing these missig values, selecting the right strategies and code, and trying to minimize bias in the analysis.
- Opportunities: To learn more about how to handle these missing values and the opportunity to try different ideas. 

## Presentation Candidate
- John Rooney 
- Business Intelligence student at NSCC

## Sample Data Selection
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavvvvv/animated-tv-shows-with-imdb-and-google-user-rating
- Criteria: Animated movies and tv shows with IMDB and Google ratings. 
- Sources: Kaggle.com
- Relevance:  I decided to pick a dataset that I thought was interesting and that also had a fair amount of missing values. This way it would be good to illustrate how to handle the values that aren't there. 

## Technical Technique Demonstration
- Description: Handling missing values involves identifying missing data patterns, selecting the right methods, and to evaluate the impact of the decisions.
- Steps:
  1) Identifying missing data pattersn using different techniques
  2) Choose a suitable technique based on previous analysis
  3) Implement the technique using Python
  4) Assess the impact of the missing data based on the results. 
- Expected outcomes and benefits: Improve data quality and reliability by addressing missing values appropriately, enhance the accuracy of the data, and increase the confidence to make reliable decisions based on the clean data. 

## Implementation Plan
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Resources required: Python and sample dataset from Kaggle
- Practice sessions every day after presentation is done to ensure that there is a smooth delivery and technical accuracy. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this presentation will focus on handling missing values and how to fix any datasets that are messy. The call to action is to apply the techniques that I have shown and use it in there own datasets to improve data quality and analysis outcomes. 

## Appendices
- Any documentation or websites that will show how to handle missing values in python
- Techniques learned in class.
