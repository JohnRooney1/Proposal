# Business Intelligence Presentation Proposal

## Introduction
Air pollution is a critical global issue with far-reaching implications for public health, the environment, and socioeconomic development. This presentation will explore the application of business intelligence (BI) techniques to analyze global air pollution data. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, organizations and policymakers can formulate effective strategies to address this pressing environmental challenge.

## Presentation Candidate
- John Rooney (Business Intelligence Student)
- Experience: Power Query, Python, SQL, Power BI, and Visual Studio.

## Data Selection
- Criteria: The dataset should include comprehensive air quality measurements across various pollutants and geographic locations, allowing for in-depth analysis.
- Potential sources: The provided dataset from Kaggle offers a wealth of air pollution data collected from monitoring stations worldwide.
- Relevance:  The chosen dataset directly aligns with the environmental domain, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into pollution trends, hotspots, and contributing factors on a global scale.

## Business Intelligence Techniques Demonstration
- Overview: The presentation will demonstrate a range of BI techniques, including data visualization, trend analysis, geographical mapping, and correlation analysis.
- Process: I will illustrate how these techniques can be applied to the air pollution dataset to uncover patterns, identify pollution sources, and assess the impact of environmental policies.
- Anticipated insights: Through different BI techniques, I anticipate to gain insights into pollution hotspots, seasonal trends, and different factors.

## Implementation Plan
- Schedule:
  1) Preparation- 2 weeks
  2) Creation- 1 week
  3) Practice- regularly
- Necessary resources: BI tools such as Power BI for visualization and Python and SQL for data analysis.
- Rehearsals: daily to ensure the presentation is effective and clear.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this presentation underscores the importance of leveraging BI techniques to address global environmental challenges such as air pollution. We encourage active engagement and collaboration among stakeholders to drive meaningful change in environmental policy and practice.
